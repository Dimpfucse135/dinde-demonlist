## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report vulnerabilities through the
[discord server](https://discord.gg/layoutlist) or by DMing Mystikl
(Mystikl#0) or sphericle (zsphericle#0). Responses to vulnerability reports usually take
from 3 hours to more than a day, depending on how difficult fixing a
vulnerability is.
